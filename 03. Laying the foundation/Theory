Q) If we have sibling elements, we have to provide keys to each sibling element. Why?

---> render means updating something to the DOM tree. 
---> Whenever we re-render on adding a new sibling, it has to modify everything inside that DOM. 
     Instead, when keys are given, it just injects the sibling wherever we want to. Keys are given as props. 
     
     
Q)  Why do we use JSX?

---> React was primarily built to create HTML tags using JavaScript. Because JavaScript is very performant. 
---> Using JavaScript we use document.createElement() method. 
     Similarly, in React they came up with React.createElement() method. 
     This method made it more complicated while creating more tags. 
     So JSX syntax was introduced.
---> const heading = </h1> Hello World </h1> 
     This is JSX.  
---> const heading = ( 
                        </h1> Hello World </h1> 
                        </h3> Hello World </h3> 
                     )
     But when we add multiple tags to a variable, we enclose them using ( ) brackets.
